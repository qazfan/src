In the year 2157, Sam, as nicknamed by the scientists who developed her, is the most advanced AI ever created by <i>HADU Industries</i>. Commissioned by the overbearing government, <i> HADU Industries</i> had created Sam to become the perfect spy and assassin. After 44 failed attempts at creating an android capable of human emotion, intelligence, and tendencies, they had finally succeeded with the 45th;  Sam.   It took years for scientists to fully master programming basic human behavior to avoid the ''uncanny valley''. Such behaviors include blinking at appropriate times, proper breathing motions, not standing perfectly still, walking with a human gait, smiling in such a way that it would crinkle her eyes, etc.  The real hard work, however, was programming her to feel actual human emotions, or to at least mimic them well enough to be nearly indistinguishable from our own .   It took years, blood, sweat, and tears, but <i>Hadu Industries</i> had finally done it.   </p><p>



<i>HADU Industries</i> had originally programmed Sam to not feel ''unnecessary'' emotions such as remorse, so that she may do whatever it takes to take down a target.  However, years down the line she <i> does</i> end up feeling these emotions.   Her own perception of the world is shattered before her own eyes.    Sam becomes extremely disconnected and fearful.  She eventually escapes the government's clutches, and spends years on the run from them.

<b>Preferred Name:</b> Sam<br><b> Assigned Gender:  </b> Female<br><b> Model: </b> SA 045<br></p><p>

<b><i> Physical Appearance</i></b>: 
Sam was given very long, white hair as that was the current ''in'' style in society during that time. 
 By human standards, she's rather pretty, though not overbearingly so.  Sam stands tall at  5'9" and her body type is best described as athletic.     Sam both looks and feels human to the touch.  If found in a crowd of full-blooded humans, it'd be nearly impossible to discern which one was the android.  </p><p>

Sam is usually seen wearing a tight, black bodysuit.  The bodysuit makes for an ideal outfit when in stealth mode, since the article provides effective camouflage.  Especially in the shadows.  When hunting, Sam will wrap her hair under a dark knit cap to avoid drawing attention to herself.  

</p><p>
<b> Personality</b>: Sam had always been a rather curious soul.  Though she'd had a lot of information about society, history, and current events uploaded into her when she was created, she still felt she had a lot to learn.    Sam does love comedy and horror holofilms.  She had always marveled at her own capability to feel fear and spent much of her time immersing herself in the films.  Anyone who met Sam were usually charmed by her outgoing personality and the mysterious air about her.  As she was not human, ordinary people could detect something rather off about her, which would leave them intrigued.   Using her charm, she eventually managed to convince her superiors to purchase a film streamer for her to use in her quarters. Sam had also been rather chatty and enjoyed getting to know about people's families and outside lives.   </p><p>

  After her initial epiphany about life, it was as though a switch had flipped, changing her almost completely. Sam became isolated and depressed, rather than the outgoing woman she once was.  She felt complete mistrust towards her superiors.  How could they allow her to do such things? To use her as a mere tool for murder and destruction?  To take countless of <i> innocent</i> lives just to take down one ''bad'' person.     After her escape, she became very introverted due to lack of trust. Her 'mental' state quickly deteriorating.  The android feels a deep sense of loneliness as she knows there's nothing else like her, and there wont be for years to come. </p><p>

 Sam feels she can't afford to be careless, so she organizes and plans everything to a great extent, down to the very last detail. If she slips in the slightest, she risks captivation. She is absolutely terrified of the thought of getting captured, shut down, and tossed away;  all of it, the murders, her existence, all of it for nothing.<br></p><center></center></center><b>TLDR;</b>

<div class="textbox2" align="justify">


<i>Beep... Beep.... Beep.</i><p>

The first sound she ever hears is the steady beeping of the machinery connected to her temples.   Immediately, she notes that she is laying flatly on some sort of hard, metal bed.  The air smells crisp; chemical. She knows she's in a brightly-lit room, as she can see the light filtered through her eyelids.  The room is relatively quiet save for the beeping and the comforting electric hum of the lights.</p><p>
  
<i>Is she awake?</i> A small female voice 
whispers.</p><p>

She can now hear the heavy, wet breaths of the people surrounding her. She doesn't need to open her eyes to know they're there, watching her. She tracks their breathing. Three to her left, and one directly to her right. Her ears catch the distinct sound of a pen scratching against paper coming from her left, near her feet.</p><p>

She can feel their eyes on her like needles piercing through her skin, and the air is thick with apprehension. </p><p>

Suddenly, she senses the person to her right reach towards her.   Her arm automatically reaches up to lock onto their forearm.  Her eyes snap open. </p><p>

</p><center><img src="http://i1083.photobucket.com/albums/j394/picturehuman/fsaf-1.jpg" width="400"></center><p>

At first, all she can see is the blinding fluorescent light coming from behind their head.  Her eyes quickly adjust and focus on the intruder standing over her.   It is a rather tall man;  approximately fifty years of age with professionally coiffed graying hair and a nice, clean-shaven face.  The man is wearing a pristine white lab coat and a black button-up shirt underneath.  Her mind registers him as F.R. Francis, engineer, <i><b> not a threat</b></i>. Her vice-like grip on the man releases, and slowly he pulls his arm back to rest by his side.</p><p>

Francis grins from ear to ear, ''Welcome to the world, SA 045.'' 　　</p><p>

She tries her hand at speaking but all that comes out is an erratic series of garbled sounds. The man lowers his brow and purses his lips in a look of concern. </p><p>She tries again, ''Hello?''

<a name="journey"><h2>Journey to bringing Sam home</h2></a>

Sam, or beauty045, is the first UC goal I've ever achieved! I believe it was around mid/late 2014 that I first decided I wanted a UC Grey Aisha in my Neopets-life. At the time, I was listening to a song (Disclosure - You &amp; Me (Flume Remix)) that weirdly inspired me to create a sad futuristic android/AI character.  The UC Grey Aisha, in my mind, perfectly fit Sam's character.</p><p>

  Amazingly, I eventually saw an xxxxxx47 format UC Grey Aisha go UFQA on the boards! I worked as hard as I could within small time frame I had to impress the owner. Felt like destiny, right? Sadly, it was not so! As most adoptions go for folks, the owner went with someone else. <img src="http://images.neopets.com/neoboards/smilies/dung.gif"></p><p>

However, after working my way up little by little, starting with a UC Werelupe I had traded a band name for, I did it!  I saw beauty045 and fell in love with the name, and brought her home in 2016.
