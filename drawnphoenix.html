<br><br><h2>Brief History of Nick</h2>
<div style="width: 665px; height: 500px; border-color: #d0c097; border-style: dashed; font-size: 14px; overflow: auto;">
<p>Phoenix - a mythical creature, legendary birds who are born from their predecessors' ashes. Only one phoenix can ever exist at one time, according to the ancient tomes thousands of years old.</p>
<p>Upon the death of phoenix Garuda, a mercenary, hired by Garuda's enemy, stole his ashes before a new phoenix could be born and scattered it to the wind. That eventful summer, the chain of phoenix was then said to have ended forever, as the ashes were lost and too spread apart to accomodate the birth of a new phoenix. But in fact, as Garuda's ashes slowly began leave the wind and coat the the earth, the legacy of the phoenix had never before been so widespread.</p>
<p>Every being that had been touched by even the smallest particle of the phoenix's ashes were either cursed or blessed with Garuda's fire magic, depending on the nature of the being. High upon an elderly oak, resided a single bird's nest; it, as well as the eggs inside, were coated in the ashes. The innocent souls within the eggs were blessed.</p>
<p>Not long after, a terrible storm ravaged the country where Garuda's ashes were lost. The deity that ruled over the area was enraged upon hearing that the phoenix line had disappeared forever; the phoenixes have brought nothing but good luck and happiness to the world over the past few millennium, and had also always been his good friends. He sent the storm to punish the people.</p>
<p>Wish had been separated from his mother and siblings merely hours after his birth, all because of the tempest that tore through the forest. They'd all been rushing to leave their home in a tree, to find a safer haven on the ground, but Wish had been buffeted by a particularly powerful gale of wind and was sent tumbling down into the forest. Fortunately, even the youngest of faellies are not completely helpless creatures, and he'd managed to find refuge in an abandoned burrow. The storm made it too dangerous for him to leave, so he settled down for a longer stay.</p> <p>He had been curled up asleep, cold and alone and wondering where his mother was, when something big and bulky dropped through the entrance to the burrow, nearly crushing him while he was sleeping! It turned out to be a big, golden egg, that was bigger than he was!</p>
<p>The egg blocked the entrance, and the terrified Wish couldn't escape. To him, it looked like a big monster! After a few minutes, though, it didn't seem like the monster was going to move. In fact, it hadn't once moved ever since it entered, so Wish cautiously poked it with a shaking paw. The shell's surface was warm - a stark contrast to the freezing cold winds that howled continuously outside. The heat resonating from inside the golden object reminded him of his mother's comforting fur. Eventually, Wish curled up asleep once more, pressed against the egg for warmth.</p>
<p>About a day later, after the storm had ended, the egg hatched. And it was on that sunny day in June that Fey was born!</p>

<br><br><h2>Nick the Feathered Parachute! (and Wish (and Kitty))</h2>
<div style="width: 665px; height: 500px; border-color: #d0c097; border-style: dashed; font-size: 14px; overflow: auto;">
<span title="Nick beams a lot, but that's usually when she's alone or with her closest friends, the introvert."><img src="http://i264.photobucket.com/albums/ii168/afifah114719200/11967eae-1cd0-4e24-a541-b73b9545152e.jpg" width="400" height="300"></span><br><br><h3>Personality</h3>
<p>A positive character, Nick loves nothing more than jumping off cliffs and ledges! ...only to deploy her tail-parachute soon after, relaxing as she floats across forests and lakes and beautiful scenic views. She prefers calmness and peace over any kind of aggression. She possesses a kind heart, and can't turn away from people in need of help... even if she can't help them.</p>
<p>In contrast to Wish's pessimistic personality, she has a constant cheerful disposition. She always picks her words carefully because she'd rather be nice to everyone, but she can be rather soft-spoken; she's not that chatty. She had, after all, spent nearly all her life with only grumpy Wish to talk to!</p>
<p>She's always open to making new friends, but at the same time she finds it hard to talk with new people - her tongue feels tied and she gets all shy and flustered. She's also a bit timid; while nobody likes being shouted at, loud voices and sounds in general make her cower and feel like hiding. (The first time she meets Hokkan is really eventful!) People who don't know her well often label her as very timid. To avoid too many awkward confrontations, she usually roams the unexplored wilderness with only Wish, sometimes dropping by her friends' houses for visits.</p>
<p>But Nick is no coward. She can be brave if she wants to be! Her tail can be a lethal weapon if she wishes it to be so, and she's defeated several evil malefactors by utilizing the strength in her tail. As much as she dislikes fighting and hurting others, she'll fight for justice if diplomacy is no longer an option. She's not technically a phoenix, but she has the heart of one!</p>
<h3>Appearance (and tail anatomy??)</h3>
<p>Nick is a small, golden-orange bird. Her eyes are a light, chartreuse green, reflecting her light and fun personality! Her wings, while they look pretty, aren't large nor strong enough to enable flight, but her legs are perfect for walking and running on the ground.</p>
<p>Her most notable physical characteristic is her tail, for it holds Garuda's blessing; her tail possesses numerous long, thick feathers that she is able to bend, twist and expand at will. She makes use of this odd ability to parachute off high places - she can spread out her tail feathers around her body and expand them, to form a parachute! That way, although she's hanging upside down, she can have a lovely view of the world from up above like any other bird that can fly.</p>
<img src="http://i264.photobucket.com/albums/ii168/afifah114719200/47e59cae-a546-47c4-9efb-fb555261e7a7.jpg" width="170" height="170"><p>Nick can also puff out her tail feathers in the opposite way! Like this, she can simply lay back and relax on top of her cushion-y tail as she floats down. From below, she even looks like a flower falling out of the sky! It's a bit hazardous, though, since she can't really see where she's headed!</p>
<img src="http://i264.photobucket.com/albums/ii168/afifah114719200/a6f639b5-8e2d-4a0f-bb8a-3ae161efcd4d.jpg" width="170" height="170"><img src="http://i264.photobucket.com/albums/ii168/afifah114719200/b37359f9-3947-46f6-a80f-5e1544362785.jpg" width="170" height="170"><img src="http://i264.photobucket.com/albums/ii168/afifah114719200/1e72296c-c164-4053-8588-8bb8d36efb7d.jpg" width="170" height="170"><h3>Wish the Sour Candy</h3>
<p>Now, Wish is Nick's 'older brother' figure - he is a day older than her, after all! After she hatched from her egg, Wish stayed with her (not that he had any other choice, but still). While it's really a mystery as to why Wish is such a grumpy character and Nick a happy one, despite the fact that they spent all over their lives together, it doesn't matter all that much - Wish definitely cares for Nick as she does him. He'll never understand Nick's love for parachuting - as he <i>hates</i> heights and falling from high places - but he's always there with her every time she takes a plunge. He's puny, but he still feels like he could be of help should anything go wrong on one of her escapades.</p>
<h3>Kitty the Freeloader (?!?!)</h3>
<p>image here</p>
<p>Kitty? Who's... oh! This adorable creature is Kitty!</p>
<p>Story goes like this: Wish had one day acquired a tick. As he continued to scratch himself furiously, Nick discovered it and thought it was really cute! So she named it Kitty and didn't allow Wish to attempt to get rid of it. So Kitty lives happily and comfortably nestled in Wish's fur, draining his body fluids and growing fat. Someday it'll either move out, or start a colony on Wish. Or perhaps it will continue to live as it always had, feeding on Wish's lifeblood. Who really knows with this cute enigma?</p>

<br><br><h2>Friends &amp; Acquaintances</h2>
<div style="width: 665px; height: 500px; border-color: #d0c097; border-style: dashed; font-size: 14px; overflow: auto;">
<p><b>(NOTE: Outdated, I don't own many of these pets anymore!)</b></p>
<p>A menagerie of colorful (or not-so-colorful) personalities, here my are most of my current pets - and perhaps, Nick's future adoptive family! - and a brief description of their relationship with Nick. Most of them are xweetoks, yes. If you're curious about one or all of them, or you just want to see more than just their faces, click on their mugshot to go to their lookup! Their lookups are mostly completed, and most of them have the beginnings of their pages up as well.</p>
<br><a href="http://www.neopets.com/petlookup.phtml?pet=myriine"><span title="Y-you... you're one of the only... you won't leave me alone, right, Nick? Can we always be friends?"><img src="http://i264.photobucket.com/albums/ii168/afifah114719200/69ae11b7-15a7-4e70-ab4c-257132158461.jpg" width="100" height="100" style="float: right; margin-left: 5px;"></span></a><p><b>Myriine.</b> A shy, lonely little ghost who is invisible to but a few people who are granted the Sight (via magical shenanigans, such as Nick or Hokkan). Born sickly and weak, he had always been nervous and had low self-esteem, but things only became worse after he passed on into the spirit plane. He often floats around, stalking his friends who are still alive, watching over them as they carry on after his death. He can go through walls and manipulate the air on a miniscule level like many ghosts can, but he can't communicate with anyone expect those who can actually see him, with the Sight. So when he finds out that Nick can see him, he pleads with her to help be his communication medium into her world - she couldn't bring herself to refuse, and so she often brings messages for his friends. (Most of them don't really believe her at first, lol.) Myr and Nick end up becoming rather close friends because they share similar shy-ish personalities. When he's not stalking his other friends, Myriine follows Nick around and they chat about mundane things.</p>
<a href="http://www.neopets.com/petlookup.phtml?pet=hokkan"><span title="PRAISE THE SKY! PRAISE THE TREES! PRAISE THE WOOORLD! OUR FLAMES OF PASSIONATE YOUTH BURN BRIGHT IN OUR HEARTS, BIRDY!!!!!"><img src="http://i264.photobucket.com/albums/ii168/afifah114719200/h.jpg" width="100" height="100" style="float: left; margin-right: 5px;"></span></a><p><b>Hokkan.</b> Always on the move, Hokkan is a fire mage who is on a lifelong journey to seek further magic knowledge. With fire being associated with destruction, he was shunned by many people in his region as they thought he would bring destruction to them. The fact that he's very loud, rash and a little rambunctious at times, qualities associated with fire, doesn't help their opinion of him! He'd never want to hurt anyone, though, and determined to prove them wrong, he set out to travel the world and learn more about his powers, in hopes that he'd someday be able to use them to help others. Of course, he gets distracted from his goal a little easily ("WHY HELLO THERE, TREES!"), and when he sees Nick floating down from the sky one day he completely flips out. He ends up teaching Nick a little fire magic (not to mention almost breaking her hearing facilities) during the short time they spend together. They're rather fond of each other so Nick often finds herself trying to find him again!</p>
<a href="http://www.neopets.com/petlookup.phtml?pet=yvelte"><span title="You think you can fly? I'LL SHOW YOU FLYING, SISTER! WOOOOOOO- *jumps off ledge*"><img src="http://i264.photobucket.com/albums/ii168/afifah114719200/m.jpg" width="100" height="100" style="float: right; margin-left: 5px;"></span></a><p><b>Yvelte.</b> A flying tree squirrel who aspires to be an acrobat. Of course, she's nowhere near that goal yet - for now, she works as a mail carrier. She tends to lose a lot of the post she's supposed to deliver, though, because she's always occupied showing off her <strike>soaring</strike> flying talents to the people down below, doing tricks and flips in the air! Though she's very amiable, she is also remarkably candid - her honesty can be brutal. She's always adamant about having things go her way, resulting in her being rather bossy. She's always busy, trying to make up for her mistakes to her boss by delivering more post, but ends up just losing most of it. Yvelte met Nick by chance while they were both airborne. She and Nick are eternal flying buddies - sometimes she soars over the forests with Nick on her back, until they reach a point where Nick hops off and floats down into the trees. Other times Nick will carry her as they parachute alongside a waterfall or anything equally as scenic. </p>
<p><i>Yvelte was created and is currently being zapped by my friend, who knew I needed a pastel xweetok for this character. She's simply a love~!</i>

Your feathers are simply stunning... may I pluck a few?"><img src="http://i264.photobucket.com/albums/ii168/afifah114719200/c243150a-2865-42f5-bf48-d9a6691febca.jpg" width="100" height="100" style="float: left; margin-right: 5px;"></span></a><p><b>Jakkku.</b> He's obsessed with beauty and himself - in his eyes, they're synonymous, as he claims to be the most beautiful being in the universe. Although his narcissism mellows out over time, after a near-apocalypse and a come to terms, he's still passionate about beauty and fashion, running a private tailoring business. He's a charming person towards those he favors, and he is in complete love with Nick's feathers. They'd make a lovely dress! Nick isn't too inclined to let him pluck them off, but since she appreciates his admiration she spares him a few feathers once in a while.

<a href="http://www.neopets.com/petlookup.phtml?pet=pyrana"><span title="Can you teach me how ta fly like you? Please?? We can even trade! I'll teach ya how to walk!!! ^O^"><img src="http://i264.photobucket.com/albums/ii168/afifah114719200/p.jpg" width="100" height="100" style="float: right; margin-left: 5px;"></span></a><p><b>Pyrana.</b> She looks rather intimidating, being the biggest specie of her biological family, but she's really super friendly! Often rather childish - eccentric, curious and naive - her friends treat her as such. She acts rather wild and rambunctious at times, as she grew up in a forest, and possesses close to zero social abilities. She used to be suspicious of everyone else and prone to violence because she would oft be hunted for her long fur. She admires Nick for a lot of reasons, mostly because she finds Nick beautiful and graceful, not to mention really kind! They both adore nature and while Nick can't teach her how to fly, they enjoy relaxing under a tree and either talking or dwelling in tranquil silence. Nick never makes fun of her awful accent, either - she even offered to help her with her English!</p>
<a href="http://www.neopets.com/petlookup.phtml?pet=puratina"><span title="Ever a curio, Nick. You are indeed an anomaly among birds.. I still have trouble accepting that feathers can bend in such a manner."><img src="http://i264.photobucket.com/albums/ii168/afifah114719200/25828d6d-476f-404d-a68f-797007a0e60b.jpg" width="100" height="100" style="float: left; margin-right: 5px;"></span></a><p><b>Puratina.</b> Princess Pura isn't allowed to go outside the castle grounds because of her overprotective father, the king. Pura is very spoiled and gets whatever she wants; but all she really likes are books and learning about the world she's not allowed to experience, so her dad got her a huge library. She's obsessed with knowledge and she used to utilize her computer to watch educational videos, but one day discovered K-pop and now she doesn't really watch anything else. Being princess, she feels superior to basically everyone else and thus acts cold towards people. However, she eventually discovers that this attitude won't help her much in the real world. She finds Nick intriguing in many ways, and always asks permission to examine her anomalous tail feathers. But Nick is gracious and lets her do so, even though she already has enough <strike>weird</strike> people obsessing over her tail!</p>
<a href="http://www.neopets.com/petlookup.phtml?pet=parhu"><span title="WHAT IS THIS. BIRDS DO NOT FLY LIKE THAT. IT'S JUST. NO. NOPE. I'M DONE"><img src="http://i264.photobucket.com/albums/ii168/afifah114719200/ea01f289-c239-4ae1-9041-f4a0442e2642.jpg" width="100" height="100" style="float: right; margin-left: 5px;"></span></a><p><b>Parhu.</b> He's the son of the King's most trustworthy knight of all. He admires his father greatly, although he's doomed to a life living in his great shadow. Instead of training as a page to become a knight like his father, Parhu works as a stable boy for the King's horses. He was born with unpredictable anger issues and has a bad temper, and no knight was willing to take him under their wing. Not wanting to bring shame to his father, he refused to become a knight and set his sights on becoming a court entertainer someday - he does enjoy making people laugh! Parhu is usually quite composed and calm otherwise, and he lives by the knights' Code of Chivalry. He <i>loves</i> making up terrible puns, convinced that his puns will be his gateway to becoming court entertainer. While Parhu still refuses to accept the fact that Nick is pseudo-parachute ("BECAUSE THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY LOGICAL SENSE, WHAT ARE YOU EVEN??") he often goes to her to help judge the quality his puns. Nick always has to fake her laughter so that she won't hurt his feelings.</p>
<a href="http://www.neopets.com/petlookup.phtml?pet=deskar"><span title="...I'm really glad there are people like you out there, Nick. Makes me feel constipated with hope."><img src="http://i264.photobucket.com/albums/ii168/afifah114719200/537aed19-9fc6-4daf-85b9-74424bfae224.jpg" width="100" height="100" style="float: left; margin-right: 5px;"></span></a><p><b>Deskar.</b> Deskar spent most of his life in darkness, locked away in the recesses of a prison after being kidnapped at a young age. Only when he managed to escape, did he realize that he had actually gone blind. Despite endless encouragements from his devoted sister, he fell depressed, feeling that not only his light, but his life had been stolen away from him. Eventually he makes a few friends, including Nick, and they bring him on adventures and whatnot, uplifting his spirit. Although he becomes a bit of a happier guy, he listens to a lot of really loud music and Nick worries about his ears!</p>
<a href="http://www.neopets.com/petlookup.phtml?pet=sarav"><span title="Could you be my parachute, lil birdie? 'Cause I think I'm falling!"><img src="http://i264.photobucket.com/albums/ii168/afifah114719200/69ae11b7-15a7-4e70-ab4c-257132158461.jpg" width="100" height="100" style="float: right; margin-left: 5px;"></span></a><p><b>Sarav.</b>This guy lives a super carefree life, switching jobs every month and gambling off his earnings at the slots (he's got luck, though, because his wins outweigh his losses). He has a penchant for either being very entertaining, or extremely irritating. He likes doing stunts and taking risks, drawing people's attention through his intense skateboarding abilities. Born rather wealthy, he's got no troubled childhood, and is pretty content. He's an obnoxious flirt, too - as if he doesn't have goals! He's actually an undercover 'police-dude', as he dubs himself, investigating a string of mysterious deaths that are continuing to occur in his city. He doesn't have a badge or anything; he was enlisted merely for his vast knowledge of his home city and everyone in it. Sarav doesn't do so great at his new responsibility, not just because he's an irresponsible guy, but because the deaths are connected to a whole other dimension! Nick treats Sarav nicely although she finds him a little too forward, what with his flirtatious ways and careless ways.</p>
<a href="http://www.neopets.com/petlookup.phtml?pet=bitob"><span title="Y-you... you're one of the only... you won't leave me alone, right, Nick? Can we always be friends?"><img src="http://i264.photobucket.com/albums/ii168/afifah114719200/69ae11b7-15a7-4e70-ab4c-257132158461.jpg" width="100" height="100" style="float: left; margin-right: 5px;"></span></a><p><b>Bitob.</b> A serious and hardworking person. The young assistant of a renowned scientist, Bee spends her daylight cooped up inside a white, sprawling laboratory. She loves her job, doing her best to be a reliable helper to the prof, but tends to overwork! While science is definitely her calling, her favorite part of the job is when it ends - because that's when her real one begins. By dusk, she'll leave the lab and go <i>demon slaying</i>, protecting the city from unseen threats. Ever since she gained the Sight, Bee had grown obsessed over these mysterious beings unseen to almost anyone else, and being a researcher, resolved to catalogue and name every otherworldly creature in existence. Unfortunately, she grows too obsessed with slaying demons... and begins to become a demon herself. Nick meets Bitob on several occasions; she really likes Bee's attitude, but each time they meet she can't help but notice a frightening change in Bee's demeanor...</p>
