(Because PP coding likes to remove quotation marks, bolded text is dialogue.) <br><br>
A young cybunny stares out the window of an abandoned house. The timber creaks slightly as the current passes thought the now empty room. In the distance she can see the sunlight streaming down from the world above.  Her face hardened when she heard cries from the distance. <br><br><b> Gelle!</b> A kougra ran into the abandoned room. <b>We need—</b><br><br>
Giggelles held up a paw, causeing the newcomer to fall silent. Silence rang in the air. The newcomer's heavy breathes swirled the dust around. There was a long pause when neither pet moved. <br><br><b> Giggelles </b> the newcomer said, gentler and calmer this time. <b>It has begun, we need you Gelle.</b><br><br>
Giggelles did not reply, just continued staring out the window, listening to the voices. <br><br>
The kougra moved closer, not touching but close. He too stared out the window and winced when he heard a cry of pain. <b>They need you</b> he said to Giggelles's back. <br><br>
Giggelles turned slightly. <b>I know</b> she replied, reaching and gripping the kougra's shoulder. <b>I just wish it hadn't come to this, Ashteean</b> <br><br>
Ashteean gripped Giggelles 's shoulder. <b>I know old friend</b> <br><br>
They paused for several moments before Giggelles turned and walked over to a dark corner, where a table lay hidden by the shadows. She picked up a belt that had several weapons on it and strapped it to her waist. She then reached for her helmet to find Ashteean holding it. <br><br>
Giggelles took the helmet and nodded gratefully at her friend. Ashteean smiled. Giggelles put the helmet on and turned into a new person. No longer was she the kind neopian who read to her cousins, or healed the sick. She was a battle hardened warrior now, and she had a score to settle. <br><br>
With a jerk of her head she and Ashteean left the old building, to join a group of battle ready warriors. They looked up at Giggelles, awaiting their orders. <br><br><b>My clan</b> Giggelles said clearly and powerfully.  <b>Today we fight for freedom, and our city and we start by fighting them</b> she said, nodding to the distant battle. She began to swim toward the fighting. With whoops and cheers her clan followed. Giggelles gave one backwards look, and only one, towards the old building and the broken sign that read <i>Santigo's Inn</i>. <br><br></div>

<h1>About<b>Gell</b>
</h1>

<br><br><b>Description: </b>Because of the way I draw her anthro, Gell can't have a lame leg, therefore her description is slightly different between her quad and anthro forms.
<br><br>*In quad form* Giggelles would have a lame left leg. It would be slightly smaller than the other, making it hard to swim. She would wear a small attachment to help her, but otherwise not cover it. She wouldn't be ashamed of how she was born. <br><br> 
*In anthro form* Due to a birth defect, Gelle has a horrible scar on her back. Because it healed so badly, she is unable to stretch or bend very well due to the scar. She is also blind in one eye, and cannot see the colour pink, which is ironic because her eyes are pink.
<br><br>
*In general*She is an excellent fighter and is always carrying some kind of blade. She has long ears, and flowing sea green hair. He tail has blue stripes etched in purple. She is always seen with a shell necklace, but she never tells anyone why. He eye are light pink, but can become quite dark when she is angry.<br><br><b>Background :</b> Giggelles would have been abandoned at birth. As her family was a warrior clan, her mother was honour bound at birth to leave her for the kelpies.  Her mother did so without any feeling, as Giggelles was a weak link, and not—in their eyes, worth being alive. Giggelles 's brother however, couldn't just leave her and stole her away to an inn, where he left her on the door step to an inn. Giggelles was then found by the inn keepers and raised. In her teens Giggelles decided she needed to prove her family wrong and began her training. Her foster parents always tried to stop her from fighting, by discouraging it and refusing to teach her. But because they ran an inn, there was an endless supply of teachers. This is why Giggelles knows so many fighting styles. Nobody thought she could do learn but she did. She then gathered a small group of friend to help her hunt daemons.  She traveled the world this way, only returning to help fight for maraqua. When the battle had been won, her clan asked her to re-join them, saying that she was worthy now. Giggelles refused saying, she was with her family now. <br><br><b>Personality :</b> Giggelles  is a well hardened warrior. Abandoned at birth, she was bullied at a very young age because of that. Since birth she has been a survivor and a rebel. Despite her disabilities, she is an excellent fighter, which has gotten her into a lot of trouble. She usually has a very calm head, but when someone is bullying someone, or insults on of her family she has a very bad temper. She has a great distrust for strangers, and is very hard to get to know.  The only people who really know her are her friends who she hunts with.  Gell was born a leader, and has taken command of her pack. Because she formed the hunting group, nobody questioned her right to lead. Through Gell show a hard person on the outside, she is really insecure inside. She fears the day when her disabilities prove too much for her to handle, and she just gives up.

<br><br>Despite her hard person, nothing can make her heart melt like Faintsy and Abuxa, her two baby cousins. She has a real sweet spot for them. When she is with them it is one of the few times when she sheds her warrior side. She loves to visit them and play with them. Gelle refuses to wear blades around them, for fear they may hurt themselves.

<h1>Story<b>Overview</b>
</h1>
I was thinking of the story being something along the line of her saving old/new maraqua. It would tie in with her background story because this would be how she proves to them that she can do anything she want too, even with a lame leg.<br><br>
It would start with Giggelles being left alone, and then go to show her brother taking her somewhere safe. Then it will continue with little bits throughout her life. Some happy, some sad, and will give you a nice Background in her story. It will then get into her life in maraqua, and her fighting for their new home, and will conclude with maraqua being saved and Giggelles finding a home. <br><br>
I have a excerpt of the story at the beginning of this app, but chose not to write the first chapter. I have the plot for it firmly in my head, but want to work on it more with Giggelles, so she doesn't have a totally completed charrie/petpage/pet look up and just sits on my account like a trophy pet.
