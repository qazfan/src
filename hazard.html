Seeking UC Dari Acara
<span><i>Currently attempting to trade for, or adopt, an unconverted pet...</i></span>
</h1>
<p>
The pet that I most desire to obtain is called Steampunk. The user named Ireland, the owner of Steampunk, will only trade her for an unconverted Darigan Acara. All my pets were converted during The Neopocalypse, and I've been unsuccessful in trading for an unconverted pet. I dearly want Steampunk. Her name has much to do with my offline life, work, hobbies, and passions. Once I obtain an UC to trade for Steampunk, then I will morph and paint Steampunk into a purple kougra, customize her, and use her to roleplay with my guild members and friends. Her name is a part of my identity: a forever cherished ideal. She would bring me great exhilaration, pleasure, and pride.<br><b>If you wish to read about my character for Steampunk, you may view my <a href="http://www.neopets.com/~Legal">Project Page</a></b>

<p><b>Dear Mermaid,</b><br>
I am seeking help creating a wraith acara to be one of my permie characters.<br>Here is a description of my character:<br><br>
The war between the underworld and the heavens has stretched on beyond recollection or record. At each age, the souls of either side are reborn, and the cycle is continued. Lucy's mother was lost in the war, and her father never revealed. It was not until her soul was recognized as the reincarnate prince of the underworld that someone finally came to claim her. Lucy now lives under the careful care of the Regent, Theadore, and his head servant, Brandan, who has been appointed as her guardian. She looks up to her guardian as a mentor, as a brother, or a father she never had. She craves any knowledge of the outside world, but her disappointed and disatisfied tutors refuse to allow her outside the gates of the palace, and give her only more seemingly pointless history and war problems and tomes to read. In Bran's care, however, she has begun to understand more of the world beyond, and of the people she will one day be responsible for. For, one day the Regent will step down, she will recover the pieces of memories of her previous lives, and she will become the ruler of the underworld.</p>
<p>I will save up money to get my wraith acara a captive shadow wraith pet. I already have her customization chosen, and I have all the items for that customization ready on my side account, lllustrative, where she will live.</p>

I go by <b>Nobody</b> when on the webs. Yes, that is a reference to Homer's epic artpiece of myth, and I am on my own Odyssey. I am an ocean loving fantasy artist and an eternally mischievous kid in an aging body. With all the implied balances of benefits and flaws, I am an extremely sincere and honest person, to the point of crude bluntness, with a passionate temperament and a great deal of sensitivity. I believe in doing my best. My current hobbies learning violin, piano, vocals, and sound editing. I volunteer at local large scale community events such as steampunk, animation, gaming, and even anthropomorphic conventions. To lighten the mood while working, I tend to arbitrarily add silly remarks like, "let me make this pretty" and "I are write is good yes." Sometimes I cause a smile!
</p>
<p>
When I am not vaugely holding up the illusion of being an adult, I am reading, writing, drawing, painting, djing, streaming, gaming, or watching films and animation.

My favorite neopet before the Apocalypse of 2007 was the striped xweetok.<br>
My favorite neopet post conversion is probably now the transparent korbat.<br>
My favorite animals are vulpes zerda, corvus ossifragus, and all lepidoptera.<br>
My favorite foods include berries, fish, teas, honey, asparagus, and spinach.<br>
My favorite colors are tinged with reds, such as pink, lavender, and maroon.<br>

<b>Character creation is what has kept me captivated by the Neopets world for going on eighteen years.</b> Since that afternoon in the library on November 13th of 2001, through the two years of middle school, the four years of high school, the four years of college, and the three years since graduation, I have kept myself entertained and enchanted by my pets and the worlds I built around them. Since my degree was in fine arts, I was able to slip my neopets characters into almost every project I worked on. I designed logos and trading cards based on my neopets characters, and crafted "faerie capturing device" product designs. My illustrations and paintings portrayed my characters in either their human or their neopet forms. Creative writing was always just a class where I was able to delve into the history and plots of my neopets. The running gag entertained me to no end. Most professors never caught on (and one who did still asks me how my "pets" are doing whenever I see him, as if we share a secret joke). Although these days I am busy with starting my career, I still make time to come relax on-line. Neopets is a nostalgic haven where I can enjoy the characters I have built, work on new ones to keep myself inspired, and chat with like minded players. Both the pleasure and the inspiration I gain from neopets help me to be more creative in my professional work, which gives me a great excuse to never leave! Mwuahahaha!<br></p>

<p>
When I am not working on my personal world building or tinkering with my characters' stories, I spend a lot of time goofing around on the boards. Sometimes I just lurk and read roleplays, and other times I chat with whoever catches my attention. I really enjoy meeting new neopians and talking about whatever is going on in their lives. I don't usually make my own threads, and I tend not to share my own life details unless I feel like it contributes to the discussion or helps in some way. I love offering advice on writing and drawing, since they're my artistic passions. Sometimes I even make new friends, and some of my friendships have lasted for many years. My guild is also of particular interest: Persona is a world and character building guild dedicated to promoting creativity, which is why I feel like I fit in well. My guild holds events where members can contribute to the story through their chosen talents, and my favourite category is lore development. It brings me pride and pleasure when I get to experience neopians coming together to make collaborative and multidimensional universes.<br></p>

I greatly fear failure, so I try not to commit to something unless I have decided that I very much want it, and that the chance of obtaining it is worth the depressing experience of not obtaining it. I like to do everything carefully and with thought. Despite my birth name, Hazard, which means 'foolish chance', I greatly dislike and eagerly avoid risk. For this reason, I seldom apply for pets, and I rarely enter contests. I have only entered the Beauty Contest once, in 2010, and although I did not win first place in the entire competition, I still received a gold trophy for the species category, which made me proud of myself. I would like to try again sometime, with Hazard perhaps. Despite my reluctance to compete, I still would like to earn trophies for my profile, as well, which is why I have decided that I want to have a submission accepted to the Art Gallery, and perhaps publish a series of comics or short stories in the Neopian Times. Since I love customization so much, it would be really great if I could one day have one of my pets featured on the front page, too! These are goals that I think most regular neopians aspire for, but it has taken me a long time to accept that I want them for myself, as well!<br></p>

Although, originally, I was first revolted by and then skeptical of the change in art style and the customization that was brought with it, the diversity of customization has now captured my fascination. I spend a lot of time on Dress to Impress trying to use the backgrounds, foregrounds, accessories, and trinkets to depict my characters as best as I can. I do not enjoy my neopets wearing clothing, but I find that many of the other wearables really help show off their personalities and backstories. It makes me smile when people compliment my customizations, or when they ask for my advice or help with creating customizations for their own neopets.<br></p>

<p>
I also spend a lot of my neopets time attempting to earn neopoints to complete my site goals. My favourite games to play on neopets are Key Quest, Hasee Bounce, and Extreme Herder. I also check the Stock Market and the Forgotten Shore every day that I am on-line. Sometimes I stop by my Habitarium to collect my little crystalized insect souls. Of late, I have been attempting to make it with the neopian stock market. I have not had much luck, and so I end up the picture of dejection, with my chin resting on my palm, staring at the deflating stocks on my screen in dull eyed disappointment. Maybe one day a random event will grace me, grease my financial wheels, and ease me along the way to completing my goals!<br></p>

<p>
I will keep playing Neopets until the site ends, or I am too senile to remember how to log in. Gaming will never become old for me. <br><i>The truth is we never grow up. We just masquerade as adults because that is what we are expected to do.</i></p>

A chimera is an experiment in genetic manipulation and the combination of species. Experiment Six was crafted from the varying genes of fennec, kingsnake, moth, and crow. The subject named Hazard displayed high intelligence while completing exercises, though it was noted that her reflexes and other senses were slow and severely diminished, something thought to be a side effect of mutation. Although a little creepy in appearance, the tiny creature was said to be adorable and sweet natured. However, when she began to mature, her personality seemed to dramatically fluctuate for no apparent reason. She developed a frightening ability to concentrate solar energy into fragmented lightning. At one moment she would behave as a sweet child, and the next as if in violent confusion. Promptly, a decision to release her from further experiments was made. A theory holds that Hazard simply lost her mind from deterioration caused by the genetic manipulation, but, since her mental fragmentation, nobody has bothered to study her closely enough to be sure of the true cause.

<span>Forget regret, or life is yours to miss. No other path, no other way, no day but today.</span>

When the person you care the most for cares nothing for herself, do you give up, or take over her care? Mal, with his cold eyes and dark appearance, has always been wrongly stereotyped as a careless, worthless delinquent. His true nature, unseen by pacserby, could not be more discredited by such an acsumption. A deep ability for empathy and compacsion resonates through his heart and soul, and the unsavory, silenced tragedies of his past have only compounded his need to bring joy and peace to others. When he finds Hazard, a confused and broken monster, he finds in himself a reason to live, and gives her the same gift. To others, Hazard is only a crazy, pathetic creature not meant to survive, but to Malice, someone who has himself been slighted by judgements too quick to be fair, she is a beautiful miracle. Through patience and thoughtfulness bestowed to his personality by his ancestors, he has chosen to take on the fight for both of their lives, to live without regret, and to not only survive, but to fully and truly live.

Light powers the world. Light allows vision, and can be transmuted into our other essential: heat. Where there is light, there is warmth and color, and often joy. What if you had the power to control light? Would you not become beloved of the world? However, what if your power over light was the ability to take it away? Prince Noire is the elder sibling of Princess Blanc, a beloved sorceress of light, though not many care to remember that he is thus, too, of noble blood. The Princess of the Land is the only one who goes out of her way to recognize his right and rank as a prince. Whereas she can use light to create warmth and illusions of hope and granduer, Noire uses his abilities with light to veil the world in shadow. He can confuse enemies in the dark, or, if the need calls, freeze them to their core. In whispers, from those who dare mention the elder royal, he is called Her Shadow. Every noble has enemies, and since he did not inherit the power that his sunshine loving people deem fit to rule, he has chosen to make what use of his ability that he can: to aggressively drain away color and warmth, to protect his sister, and their land.

Light powers the world. It allows vision, and can be transmuted into our other essential: heat. Where there is light, there is warmth and color, and often joy. Princess Blanc has the fated responsibility of representing this, for she has the power to control light. Her beloved and talented elder brother might have inherited the kingdom instead of her, if he had been better able to summon forth this sacred energy. To her great insecurity, Blanc's power is incomplete: however great her talent to summon light, she utterly lacks the ability to dim it. The common populace of her kingdom does not care or fault her, as long as she is able to light the way. Most do not actually know that light flows two ways, and so do not even understand that her power is lacking. They fear the ability to subtract light, which her brother, the Prince Noire, excels at. With his power, he has learned to be aggressive where she can or will not, and he protects her with his life, from the shadows of their land. Blanc only wishes that she could show her people how wonderful the other side of the light can be, and how necessary it is for them all.

Dramatic, pedantic, romantic, and rather insane, Theadore could be easily identified as an accociate of the theatre. As a mere halfblood born to a wild clan of unseelie faeries, his talent with the arcane was pathetically lacking, and he resorted to vampirism. For years he preyed upon villages before he came to a port city, took up residence in a theatre, and claimed the entertainment district as his domain. Masquerading as a member of the aristocratic elite, he honed his talent at manipulation and subterfuge. Through black market exploits and black mail, his ownership over the city and its inhabitants grew. However, he ever craved more recognition, more control, and in his abuse and blind scramble, he found both his deepest downfall and his greatest rise in rank yet. Warped with irresponsibly used magic, he was dragged into the underworld without true death. There his disturbing habits served him well. With underhanded use of  necromancy, he soon became a Councillor, and then Regent. However, when the latest reincarnate Prince of the underworld is identified, he realizes that there is now yet another obstacle he must overcome in his quest for ultimate power.

Brandan was a humble and gentle man with loved ones and farmland of his own before he died. That was so long ago, yet in the dim of his fading memory, he remembers the fire of life, a flame that lit his soul with pacsion and fury. After a necromancer brought him back from the dead to become a ghoul, a tortured minion of the underworld, he was left with but mere remnants of emotion. Ever patient, ever rational, Bran bided his time of servitude, even as years of harsh treatment went by. Then, when the latest reincarnate prince of the underworld was identified, he was acsigned to be a personal guardian to the young Lucy. Despite his cruel enslavement and hatred towards his captor who commanded him to this post, and despite his apparent apathy for everything else around him, it has become apparent that his time with Lucy, so remnicient of his daughter from ages past, has begun to change him once again. For, beneath the stoic demeanor of this tragic lost soul, a faintly remembered feeling threatens to flicker to life whenever he is near his new ward. Perhaps once more his heart will catch fire, for from it there are signs of smoke.

Sometimes children are born different. Strange. Abnormal. Genetically defective. Lilith was born with hair white as snow and eyes red as roses. When her mother first saw her placed into her arms, she screamed at the transluscent demon. Not everyone is cut out to be a parent. Lily lived her childhood through one foster home and another, always causing trouble, resentful of her lot in life. Then she met Kain, and they became adopted siblings in the home of a wealthy retired chef who had no children of his own. When he suddenly passed away too soon, the two teens quickly learned how to slip through the holes of the law to forge their own life. However, Lilith's nature caused her to stray. Instead of continuing her education, she took a job at the docks. Her brother thinks she runs errands, when her work actually entails black markets and unsavory characters. She seems unable to help herself when it comes to thrill seeking, but her love of adventure may lead her into more trouble than her wits can get her out of one day.

<span>Rhea fought valiantly, Rhea fought nobly, Rhea fought honorably. And Rhea died.</span>
</h1>

<p>
Determined, deliberate, dutiful, and dead. Prince Rhea was born to a king and a commoner, given his title by fondness of the king, yet never treated as family by his father's other children. He studied well, learned to fight well, and, when he reached of age, he was given his own keep at the edge of the kingdom to preside over. Prince Rhea ruled without cruelty, and dealt with his hall justly. However, he did not know his people. An old wise woman challenged him to learn the ways of his people, to tread the paths of his land. His pride chastined, he went on a journey to understand the commoners, and it was to be a time of self discovery as well. He fished, hunted, farmed. He worked and wept. He loved. Then his eldest brother started a war, and Rhea was called to champion this battle with the east. He fell to the fires of war, and died. From the fires he was reborn again, for his maternal ancestor had in truth been a magical spirit. Torn through time, he took on a dragon's form, with a dragon's rage for all that he lost.

Angels are born, and they are not always good. This one was not evil, but he was not exactly cut out to follow rules. He allows no record of his passing to be kept, and he gives no one his true name. Angel, as he calls himself, strays far out of the legal bounds one would expect of his kind. He lives and wanders with vagabonds and miscreants, a traveller and a freeloader. He takes what he needs and gives freely, and has given the shirt off his back to another in need. Angel helps those in need more often as he helps himself, but the trouble he gets into is more memorable than the good he does. His generosity flows as freely as his smile, but his manners are nothing graceful. At least once a month he visits a cathedral or shelter and pays homage. Yet he holds no true faith of his own, and has chosen to blaze his own fate. Most of that path involves crime and debauchery, with a cheeky smile departing smart mouth farewells.

The war between the underworld and the heavens has stretched on beyond recollection or record. At each age, the souls of either side are reborn, and the cycle is continued. Lucy's mother was lost in the war, and her father never revealed. It was not until her soul was recognized as the reincarnate prince of the underworld that someone finally came to claim her. Lucy now lives under the careful care of the Regent, Theadore, and his head servant, Brandan, who has been appointed as her guardian. She looks up to her guardian as a mentor, as a brother, or a father she never had. She craves knowledge of the outside world, but her disappointed and disatisfied tutors refuse to allow her outside the gates of the palace, and give her only more seemingly pointless history and war problems and tomes to read. In Bran's care, however, she has begun to understand more of the world beyond, and of the people she will one day be responsible for. For, one day the Regent will step down, she will recover the pieces of memories of her previous lives, and she will become the ruler of the underworld.
