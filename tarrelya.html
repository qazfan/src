<h1>Welcome, welcome!</h1>

<h3> To Tarrelya's pageeeeee</h3><p>
  </p><p>

Please do not use any of my art or content! I've spent a lot of time working on his character and page.  </p><p>

I was lucky enough to be chosen to adopt Mxxxxxxxxx the UC Grey Acara in order to trade for a UC Robot Ixi! I am incredibly grateful!</p><p>


 I'll warn you now that I'm no expert on any of these upcoming subjects.  I just like the sci-fi aesthetic ok. I'm working on researching everything you see below and eventually I want to focus on turning all these ideas into a full-blown story that... makes some kind of sense and isn't too awful.   </p><p>

NOTE: my little universe is a different, but similar universe to our own.   this is not earth.  if you started talking about places like paris or california, they'd be like 'omg what r u talking about u fool'

 <p>
Amarantha's story begins in the year 2180, 23 years after the big scandal with HADU industries regarding the secret development of the AI assassin, SA-045.   Things have settled down and there's a new big shot tech company, Aeon Tech, that has taken over HADU industries' place on the technological throne. Aeon Tech deals with the development of super cool technology, ranging from your average household appliances, to AIs.  Their most controversial product to date would be the release of <i> Mind Uploading</i>. </p><p>

 Mind Uploading entails uploading the minds of people and storing them in a central server overlooked by Aeon Tech, then later downloading said minds into androids once they die.  Now, even though it <i>is</i> technically possible to upload the mind of someone after they're pronounced dead, you have a very small window to do so.  You <i>must</i> preserve the brain cryogenically as soon as humanly possible, as brain tissue begins to deteriorate roughly five minutes after oxygen starvation. Therefore,  it is highly, highly recommended to upload the mind at least once while alive as it speeds up the downloading process and lowers the risk of data corruption.  Another reason one wants to download the mind during life is to minimize the risk of not being able to come back at all in case the brain is too damaged to recover.  It is also recommended to update your memories about every 6 months or so.  As mentioned, it is possible to acquire memory data postmortem, but the window to do so is very small unless the brain is properly preserved in time.   

</p><p>Uploading one's mind is a pretty easy and cheap thing to do (clever marketing trick).    However, here's the catch:  actually downloading the mind into an android is an <i>extremely</i> costly thing to do. Aeon Tech has a monopoly on the Mind Uploading business due to the fact that the company holds the global copyright on the matter. Of course, there are still ways for people who don't have the money to bring a loved one back.  Loans are available for people, though it does bury them in debt. </p><p>

The government in Amaranath's world is incredibly corrupt in every sense of the word.  Certain companies do buy out  politicians, as a way to further gain more power and wealth.  Politicians line their pockets with an outrageous amount of money at the expense of others.   It's a fact the government is constantly surveilling their citizens, unbeknownst to them, in whatever way they can.

<center><img src="http://i1083.photobucket.com/albums/j394/picturehuman/chartt.png"></center><br><p>


<b>Personality</b>: Amarantha prefers being alone and avoids crowds to the best of her abilities.  After all, she was brought into the world bearing a pretty deep secret that not only affects her own life, but the lives of all the people around her.  Amarantha prefers to lead operations, as she is very distrustful towards others and doesn't believe anyone can do a better job than she.  It's her way or the highway, and folks need to deal with it.  She's not the most loyal person you'll come across.  Her duty trumps over anything else in her life, and if it means she needs to double-cross someone to further her mission, she'll do it.    </p><p>

<br><br><h1>Significant Characters</h1>
<p>
</p><h2>SA-045</h2><img src="http://i65.tinypic.com/mhzjsz.png" class="left" style="border-radius: 150px;" height="210">  In the year 2157, Sam, as nicknamed by the scientists who developed her, is the most advanced AI ever created by HADU Industries. Commissioned by the overbearing government, HADU Industries had created Sam to become the perfect spy and assassin.<p>
 After 44 failed attempts at creating an android capable of human emotion, intelligence, and tendencies, they had finally succeeded with the 45th; Sam. It took years for scientists to fully download and program basic human behavior. Such behaviors include blinking at appropriate times, proper breathing motions, not standing perfectly still, walking with a human gait, smiling in such a way that it would crinkle her eyes, etc. The real hard work, however, was programming her to feel actual human emotions. It took years, blood sweat and tears, but Hadu Industries had finally done it. They had manufactured the perfect assassin.</p><p>
Sam is a sort of celebrity in the city of Orbis.  Only five years after her creation, Sam came forward publicly about her existence and revealed HADU Industries for what they were.  After releasing said information to the public, she went into hiding.  23 years later, she encounters Amarantha, where they join forces to bring down Aeon Tech.   
<br><br><br><br></p><h2>Jyn</h2><img src="http://imageshack.com/a/img922/1041/Ybqq96.png" class="right" style="border-radius: 150px;" height="210">

   Jyn's passion was always technology.  She had to have all of the latest gadgets, and she had to have them pronto.  Her love of technology carried on to adulthood, as she furthered her studies in computer engineering.  Later, she took an internship at Aeon Tech, her dream company to work for, and worked hard to make it in the company.  Later, Jyn was hired on as a memory interface specialist.  Her job involved developing memory imprinting and editing techniques for Mind Uploading.  Androids are, by default, connected to a central server and are always transmitting new memories to the server as they are created.  Jyn's job was to develop more efficient ways to process this memory data, and in order to develop these new techniques, she sometimes had to flip through and watch the memories of others.  She sees something she's not supposed to, decides she needs to reveal the truth, and creates Amarantha as a sort of fail-safe.  In a way, she is Amarantha's mother/creator.

<br><br><h1>to do list</h1>


<h3>ideas to cover</h3>
why do i torture with all these sciency-techy things that i need to research so i dont sind like a babbling idjit? i dont know wubbalubbadubdub<p>

</p><li>Wireless electricity stuff and charging (computers that process information via photons)</li><li>Solar-panel sidewalks/streets</li>
<li>self-driving vehicles </li>
<li>lots of philosophy.   Are the people who come back as a Droid still that person or just a simulation? Does that person continue to live on? </li><br><p>
</p><p></p><p>
</p><center><img src="http://imageshack.com/a/img923/4391/vNQxzn.png" width="450"><br>
Security droids.  Not sentient beings.  They're connected to cameras around the city, so in case harm comes to their ''Eye'', they can still come after you.  They're super scary and tall.  Concept design shamelessly inspired by the KX-series security droids seen in Star Wars:  Rogue One .<p>

</p><h3> things to do with this page</h3>
<li>Add a navigation bar</li>
<li> Figure out how to code a click-through intro with my comic</li>

<center><img src="http://i1083.photobucket.com/albums/j394/picturehuman/curious.png" width="400"><br>originally i was going to have Amarantha just be a girl who came back and her struggling with coping that she's a robot  (I'm still gonna have her struggle with this) but I also wanted her to be this kickbutt droid lady who wants to watch the world burn alongside with Jyn,  who is both herself and her creator!!! So I'll be making a different comic now lol /cries

I'm super honored to have been chosen out of the many people that applied.  I saw some of the other applications and wow wow wow they were <i>really</i> good!  <br><br>
 
Thank you,  Merry!  I know the decision must have been hard.  I'm incredibly grateful.
